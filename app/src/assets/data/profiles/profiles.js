      "Marie-Ève was my first supervisor at Cirque du Soleil. I was an intern and she cared for me so much that near the end of it, she sent me to Las Vegas to see all the Cirque du Soleil shows and talk to the office people in Vegas about a project. Imagine.. an intern went on a corporate trip in Las Vegas! This nurtured my confidence and I ended up spending 3 amazing years at this company. Thank you Marie-Ève!!",

      "2 years ago, you ran across Canada for cancer research because it was personal to you. You and your friends (the Montreal runners) raised 70 thousand dollars over your three runs. Then, you went on speak at schools and events, not because you were paid for it, but because you knew it could help and inspire people. Thank you Marc.",
